Carno is the operating system for home renewables installation businesses. It is a platform that helps businesses manage their heat pump operations, from quoting to installation.

This was my first professional developer role, and I was fully responsible for the whole application as founding engineer. The stack was React Native with Typescript, and a backend of Firebase with an express server for admin and cloud functions.
