The ReactJS UI can be found [here](https://github.com/thewatergategroups/adminui)

I built a oAuth2 and JWT based authentication API from scratch to better understand how authentication works at its lowest level.
It was built to run in Kubernetes alongside [oAuth2 Proxy](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy) for session management.
The aim was to bring authentication at the ingress level to all other applications running in the cluster. 
This application is built to specification so that it works with any application that can connect to custom OIDC providers.

This was built to be used by individuals ( Users ) and machines ( Clients ). The features thus include the creation and management of 
Users, Clients, Scopes and Roles.

Implemented OIDC flows:
 - Authorization Code Flow
 - Implicit Flow 
 - Password Flow
 - Client Credentials Flow 
 - Refresh Token Flow

I also spent time creating an Admin UI which allows a user to view their profile, 
and if they have permissions to add, remove and update Users, Clients, Roles and Scopes.
This was built with React and TypeScript, using Mantine components.
