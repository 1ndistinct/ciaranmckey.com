Darktrace Cloud is a comprehensive cybersecurity platform designed to help organizations secure and manage their cloud environments. The core principle of operation involves enumerating all cloud assets misconfigurations such as S3 buckets with overly permissive access. It offers tools to customize security postures, guide the user through remediation steps, and streamline workflows with features like one-click ticket creation and autononous response.

Interactive architecture diagrams provide a visual overview of cloud assets, enabling security teams to explore permissions, highlight attack paths, and prioritize vulnerabilities. Beyond its core cybersecurity focus, the platform includes dashboards for compliance scores, cost analysis, and integrations with third-party frameworks. It also supports "shift-left" practices by scanning infrastructure-as-code repositories to identify potential issues before deployment.
