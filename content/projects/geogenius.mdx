GeoGenius is a geography themed quiz website inspired by [higher-lower](https://www.higherlowergame.com/). The project is configured to use Firebase for user auth and storage, for which I made a separate API [repo](https://github.com/davidculemann/GeoGenius-BE).

Fun fact, the project is a remake of one of my first full stack projects, which I built in 2021 while learning React. My aim was to gauge how far my developlnent improved and to implement new technologies and best practices that I picked up.
